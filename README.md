# about-me-201d45
Welcome to this little About Me page. Here you will find some fun and professional facts about me, along with a few questions and guessing games to interact with as a way of telling even more about myself.

The code here has been built using the Code Fellows 201d45 class lectures and demos. I have also utilized Jon Duckett's book Javascript & jQuery, particularly chapter 4. MDN was a useful resource in adding the .toLowerCase() method to allow for more input options for the yes/no questions.

I was having some issues with the format of Question 6, particularly in getting the console.logs to work even though to me it looked like they should have worked the same as in the previous questions. After watching code review in class of Aliya's project and seeing that the format was similar to mine, I made appropriate adjustments based on Nicholas' feeback. 

I wanted my answers for the guessing game to be visible to the viewer after completing the prompts. I knew I had, years ago, created hovering text with some simple HTML edits but couldn't remember how to do it. I found a solution here:

and also changed text color within that tag to match my CSS list items.
